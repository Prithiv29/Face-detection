# Face-detection
This project is a computer vision-based project and captures faces by live video and creates a rectangular box around it
Objectives
1.Detect human faces accurately from images or video
2.Understand how classical computer vision algorithms work
3.Apply OpenCV models in real-world scenarios

Tech stack:
*Opencv
*Numpy
*python
*Model:Haar cascade classifier
